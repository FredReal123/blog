        <h2>1. Choose Your Garden Type</h2>
        <p>Before you dive in, decide what kind of garden you want. Here are a few common options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vegetable Garden:</strong> Perfect for growing your own fresh produce.</li>
            <li><strong>Flower Garden:</strong> A colorful garden filled with blooming plants.</li>
            <li><strong>Herb Garden:</strong> Great for small spaces, with herbs like basil and mint.</li>
            <li><strong>Container Garden:</strong> Grow plants in pots or containers, ideal for limited space.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Pick the Right Location</h2>
        <p>The success of your garden depends on its location. Consider the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sunlight:</strong> Ensure your garden gets at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight.</li>
            <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Choose fertile soil or use good-quality potting soil in containers.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Make sure your garden is easy to access for watering and maintenance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Select Your Plants</h2>
        <p>Choose plants based on your climate, space, and time. Research your USDA Hardiness Zone to know which plants will thrive. Start with easy-to-grow plants like tomatoes, sunflowers, or herbs.</p>

        <h2>4. Prepare the Soil</h2>
        <p>Healthy soil is key. Loosen the soil, amend it with compost or fertilizers, and remove any weeds to give your plants the best foundation.</p>

        <h2>5. Planting Your Garden</h2>
        <p>Follow instructions on seed packets, plant at the right depth, and ensure proper watering right after planting.</p>

        <h2>6. Care for Your Garden</h2>
        <p>Regular care includes watering, mulching to retain moisture, and feeding plants with fertilizers. Keep an eye out for pests and manage them with natural remedies.</p>

        <h2>7. Harvesting Your Crops</h2>
        <p>Know when to harvest each plant. Harvesting regularly encourages more growth and provides fresh produce or flowers.</p>

        <h2>8. Enjoy Your Garden</h2>
        <p>Take time to relax and appreciate the beauty of your hard work. Your garden will become a peaceful retreat.</p>

        <h2>Final Tips for a Successful Garden</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Patience is Key:</strong> Gardening takes time and learning, so be patient.</li>
            <li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Begin with a small garden and grow as you learn more.</li>
            <li><strong>Learn as You Go:</strong> Keep experimenting and take notes on what works best in your garden.</li>
